# ioa-rest-api-bi
This repository contains tutorials for using IRMA onAir's REST-API with self-service Business Intelligence software suites. Those tools allow connecting to the REST-API and building reports from it without coding skills, but by using the graphical user interface. Once the REST-API is set up as a data source, you can create custom reports that enable analyzing Automatic Passenger Counting data from your fleet in detail.
